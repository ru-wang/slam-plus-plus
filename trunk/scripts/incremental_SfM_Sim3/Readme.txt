This is an incremental BA dataset modification script. The ordinary BA datasets
are not suitable for incremental processing because all the cameras are usually
at the beginning of the graph and the points are then added in undefined order.

This is done in the context of SfM in Sim(3) which has some peculiar edges and
is difficult to process using the gawk script for incremental BA. Also, unlike
in the incremental BA script, the cameras are already in a valid order, as the
data was generated by a SfM pipeline. The Sim3_DS_Inc contains a Visual Studio
project which reorders the dataset. The input file name is written directly in
the source code, the output is printed to stdout.

Although there is no Makefile, this should build in Linux as well.

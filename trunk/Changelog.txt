Changes from 2.2 to 2.3 (2017-10-15):

* Added the 3DV demo and the dog leg (DL) solver

Changes from 2.1 to 2.2 (2017-05-15):

* Added robust functions.
* Improved CMake support for Visual Studio 2015.
* Added Eigen 3.3 and support for AVX instructions sets.
* Added block LU decompositions.
* Added the geometry module (P3P, PNP, five-point, Kabsch, etc.).
* Improved the order of options in cmake-gui to reduce clutter.
* Added Notify_LinearizationChange() to the solvers, to be able to do IRLS or
  otherwise externally change the linearization point.
* Noted how Sim(3) is slightly different from the representation used in Sophus.

Changes from 1.5 to 2.1 (2016-08-09):

* Added documentation groups.
* Added edge constructors with implicit and explicit vertex initialization to make
  it easier to write new edge types.
* Injected 5D and 6D matrix and vertex types into the Eigen namespace.
* Added nicer antialiased line rasterizer.
* Added proper support for constant vertices.
* Reduced memory usage in covariances calculation.
* Added Eigenvalue calculation capabilities.
* Added tools for error evaluation in SLAM implementations.
* Added a tool fur calculating exact numbers of FLOPs in sparse matrix operations.
* Added new BA examples.
* Added support for Sim(3) types.
* Optimized includes for faster builds (using Deheader).
* Plenty of improvements to the block matrix class.

Changes from 1.5 to 2.0 RC (2015-11-25):

* Blazing-fast marginal covariance recovery. More details can be found at
  https://sourceforge.net/p/slam-plus-plus/wiki/Fast%20Covariance%20Recovery/.
* Added native support for hypergraphs (the current version supports hypergraphs,
  but does not contain any hypergraph edge implementations).
* Improved Lambda solver for faster bundle adjustment.
* Support for GPU acceleration (experimental; need to enable that in CMake).

Changes from 1.12 to 1.5 (2015-02-30):

* The distortion parameter in BA (both mono and stereo) is scaled by focal
  length in the internal representation. This is compensated for in the parser.

Changes from 1.1 to 1.12 (2013-11-28):

* Added small_online_example.

Changes from 1.10 to 1.11 (2013-11-08):

* Improved code documentation.
* Improved parser design to support vertex initialization (for BA).
* Changed CMakeLists.txt and added slam_small_example.

Changes from 1.1 to 1.10 (2013-08-02):

* Fixed some bugs in bundle adjustment.
* Fixed some old typos.
* Added more configuration options to CMakeLists.txt.
* Prepared some stuff for Raspberry Pi.

Changes from 1.01 to 1.1 (2013-06-24):

* Added native block Cholesky implementation.
* Added the fast L solver, which is described in our Rss 2013 paper.
    * Note that it will not work with other than native Cholesky.


Changes from 1.0 to 1.01 (2013-05-14):

* Updated Cholmod to 2.1.2 and selected the fast supernodal analysis as default.
* Updated METIS to 4.0.1, and selected it to be disabled by default as it was
  causing problems while compiling on some Linux systems.
* Disabled -march=native on Apple systems, as it was causing problems.

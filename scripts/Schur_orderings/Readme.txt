These are scripts to be ran from a supercomputer.

These scripts are testing and recording orderings
for Schur complement.

These scripts are not supposed to be used by mere
mortals.

check_SLAMs_BAs.sh - display an overview of which
                     orderings are generated.
run_SLAMs.sh - generate orderings for common SLAM
               datasets.
run_BAs.sh - compute orderings of our BA datasets
             and venice.
run_nested_*_schur_analysis.sh - runs analysis of
                                 nested Schurs on
                                 problems of type
                                 '*'.
